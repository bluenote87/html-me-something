                        Some thoughts on headphones:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Headphones are interesting little gadgets that complement my passion for music. They present musical performances in an intimate and cost-effective manner. Although the technology is fairly mature, there are still multitudes of different implementations from manufacturers all over the world. From $5 Apple earbuds to the Sennheiser Orpheus with a price tag comparable to a new car, every pair of cans in between brings something new to the table.
